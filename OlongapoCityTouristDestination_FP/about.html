    <h1>The Legend of Olongapo City</h1>

    <h3>The Legend of Olongapo City</h3>
-->
<p >
    Once upon a time, along the shores of Subic Bay, there was a village. Its leader, an old man, was famous for his love and care for his tribe. The leader was known as Apo. He was intelligent, good and just. He favored no one and treated every one fairly. He was loved by all.<br><br>
    </p>
    <p>
    The village of this model Apo became a good example for the nearby settlement. His name became a byword. Any dispute and conflict heresolved with justice and fairness. He inspired goodwill and nurtured hope in his people to combat sufferings brought about by calamities. However, because of his greatness, evil men with intentions of conquering his tribe became envious of him.<br><br> 
    </p>
    <p>
    One morning, the village was awakened by the news that Apo was taken by unscrupulous tribesmen. The villagers searched for the Apo in the forest and mountains for several days but in vain.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
    One day, the villagers were taken by surprise when a boy returning from the forest, claimed that he found the head of the Apo at the foot of the mountain, impaled on a bamboo pole, They soon learned that the Apo was killed by his abductors, who cut his head off in order to cast fear among the villagers and succeed in their evil intent.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
    Realizing that they should now bury their beloved Apo with all the honors, they met the boy carrying the head amid loud shouts of “Ulo ng Apo” (head of the chieftain). This become the rallying cry for the village and inspired the villagers to unite against all the enemies.<br><br>
</p>
<p>
    But the village, instead of being frightened became enraged because of the hideous thing done to their beloved leader. The villagers punished the culprits and in order to cherish and emulate the example of the leadership shown to them by Apo, they called their village ULO NG APO (head of the chieftain). Thus the community was named OLONGAPO.<br><br>
