          <h5>DID YOU KNOW why Olongapo celebrates her fiesta on Rizal Day?
            Unlike other town fiestas, which are celebrations of their patron saints, Olongapo celebrates her fiesta on Rizal Day, December 30. Why is that so?
          </h5>
          <h5> According to www.-olongapofiesta.com, the official website of the Olongapo Fiesta Committee, the American administrators in the early 1900s had to follow the local Roman Catholic fiesta tradition—a time to give thanks to the Almighty and to make plans for improvements of the town. Had this tradition been followed, Olongapo would have been celebrating her fiesta every August 16, the Feast of San Roque, Olongapo’s patron saint.
            But many prominent families were members of religious groups such as Aglipayan Church, Methodist Church, the Episcopal Church, the Seventh Day Adventists, the Church of Christ, and the Iglesia ni Cristo.
            To accommodate all the religious dominations, the Americans decided on a secular celebration for the fiesta and introduced Rizal Day (December 30) as the town fiesta and also to commemorate the death of the national hero of the country</h5>
